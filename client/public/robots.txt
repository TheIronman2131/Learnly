Who dares to cross the bridge?
John, who lost his job, started working at McDonalds.
Joe, who won the lottery, retired from his job at the golf course last week.
To whom should I give this gift?

Whoever ate my cookie will feel pain.
Whoever crashed into my car will lose their license.
Whoever downlaods my program will have their data collected.

You will need these items for the spring trip: a tent, shampoo, a rope, and a boat.
